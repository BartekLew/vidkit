vidkit
------------
project aims developing sufficient, KISS tool for video editing.

my current workflow is following:
 * I copy my files from device to local file system.
 * I choose all interesting parts with vidtake.
 * I use vidcrop to set reasonable cropping for all of them.
 * I edit .vidkit-cuts to make custom changes, mostly eq2 filter.
 * I use vidshow to make preview of changes.
 * I use vidvid to generate final video.

You might be interested in other tools for exceptional situations:
 * vidcode — returns all preferences for cut label stored.
 * vidls — creates screenshots in movie to find the moment.

all needed details in code. Depends on wait_nfo tool from my workplace repo.
