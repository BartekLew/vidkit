vidkit
------------
project aims developing sufficient, KISS tool for video editing.

currently consists of 2 scripts:
 * vidls — makes galery of screenshots for choosing proper place to cut.
 * vidtake — workflow for getting right times to cut video.

all needed details in code. Depends on wait_nfo tool from my workplace repo.
